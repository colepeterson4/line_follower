In this code we take in an image from the camera in ros, then crop it down and resize it, so that it is small
enough that we can quickly perform calculations on each pixel. Then we turn it into an hsv rather than bgr.
Next we iterate through each pixel checking for yellow colored pixels. We then average the horizontal position
of these yellow pixels to get the center of the line on the floor. If this average value is to the left of the
middle of the image then we turn right, and if it is to the right then we turn left. This allows us to follow
the line on the ground.
